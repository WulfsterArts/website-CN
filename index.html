    <p>Welcome to my website. This is mainly a portfolio of my work, where you can find an assortment of illustration projects that I've made over the years.
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm a Liverpool-born Illustration Graduate and a freelance illustrator as of current. You can find more of my illustration work in my <a href="content.html">Gallery</a> page. Here's some previews though!

    <h3>Portfolio Excerpt</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="excerpt">
                I'm a Liverpool-based Illustrator, well-educated in Cardiff, and proud of it.
                <br>
                I've had a Graphic Design based background, but my skills lie mostly in Illustration.
                <br>
                <br>
                Images can be beautiful. Images can be of any aesthetic. When images tell a story, real or fictional, they can truly mean something.
                When an image speaks not just to your face, but to your heart, that's when you know it was made by an illustrator.
                <br>
                <br>
                This is something I've been striving towards for a long time. I want to create images that don't just speak, but make people listen.
                Comedy, tragedy, love story. Whatever genre it is, I want to send a message through it.
                <br>
                <br>
                My interests lie in the realms of comics and graphic novels. Telling stories and creating worlds is an avid dream of mine.
                I also have a knack for posters and editorial images, as it ties in with my goals of sending a message to a given audience.
                <br>
                <br>
                I hope that my artwork sends a message to you about who I am.</span>
